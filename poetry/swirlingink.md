title: She Must Accept Some Swirling Ink
...
May 2010

Before the caustic brute she cowers.  
It shudders with stone and towers.  
She's plain; Her simple orbs observe  
horizons as flat, and fervor  
as unbecoming. She is fear,  
a place to hide as it grows near.  

she cowers Yet, for the beast roils  
with flame and frozen spilled dreams' spoils  
with mares of night, and ocean night.  
It's stronger in its chaos - flight  
not possibile. Before and since  
it lies, both dawn and dusk a fence.  

Her eyes must drink it to survive,  
she must stop stalling, and arrive.  
She must accept some swirling ink  
into her milk, and sigh, and drink.

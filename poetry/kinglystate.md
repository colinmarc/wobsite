title: The Kingly State
...
October 2008

When from the moon, I look below,  
Where thousands, standing for the show,  
Hold up their signs, just green or red,  
Or blue if tears must win instead,  
And faithfully they make a scene,  
And faithfully, a tired screen,  

I cannot help but sit a spell,  
And put the pen back in the well.  
A world so eager to proclaim  
No innocence, or shoulder blame,  
Is far too easy to abstract,  
By pen or by a networked act.  

This world deserves no confidence,  
And I'll give it no drooling trance.  
I pick and choose which worlds to love.  
I stare at her from far above.  
I have that power as of late,  
The crown is mine, the kingly state.

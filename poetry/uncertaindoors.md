title: Behind Uncertain Doors
...
February 2012

The walk to work runs past a store,   
with dollar books by a red door,   
old wood, with paint that chips;  
the flakes stick to the concrete steps,  
and pool beneath the smokey windowpanes.  
This front obscures what it contains;  
which might be nothing, after all,  
beyond a long and shadowed hall.  
 
But if, tomorrow, it were gone?  
If behind a well-kept lawn   
the store became a charming house,  
where some girl in a flowered blouse  
sat on the porch, forlorn—would I  
notice? If I commuted by  
the sea, long grass and shining shore,  
instead of the uncertain store?  

I don't think I would ever see—  
My eyes are always home to thee.

				<h2>The Moments</h2>

<p>May 2011</p>

<p>when sycophantic stars alight <br />
on her galactic pools—bright are <br />
those moments when gaze lowers skies <br />
and the horizon burns (and fades) and dies;  </p>

<p>when ptolemaic spheres align <br />
and curtains shatter from the shine— <br />
strong are those moments when the truth <br />
is far, far less (to us) uncouth;  </p>

<p>observe this place that's yet untrod <br />
it's yours, you made it, you. (are god)  </p>

				<h2>She Must Accept Some Swirling Ink</h2>

<p>May 2010</p>

<p>Before the caustic brute she cowers. <br />
It shudders with stone and towers. <br />
She's plain; Her simple orbs observe <br />
horizons as flat, and fervor <br />
as unbecoming. She is fear, <br />
a place to hide as it grows near.  </p>

<p>she cowers Yet, for the beast roils <br />
with flame and frozen spilled dreams' spoils <br />
with mares of night, and ocean night. <br />
It's stronger in its chaos - flight <br />
not possibile. Before and since <br />
it lies, both dawn and dusk a fence.  </p>

<p>Her eyes must drink it to survive, <br />
she must stop stalling, and arrive. <br />
She must accept some swirling ink <br />
into her milk, and sigh, and drink.  </p>

				<h2>The Kingly State</h2>

<p>October 2008</p>

<p>When from the moon, I look below, <br />
Where thousands, standing for the show, <br />
Hold up their signs, just green or red, <br />
Or blue if tears must win instead, <br />
And faithfully they make a scene, <br />
And faithfully, a tired screen,  </p>

<p>I cannot help but sit a spell, <br />
And put the pen back in the well. <br />
A world so eager to proclaim <br />
No innocence, or shoulder blame, <br />
Is far too easy to abstract, <br />
By pen or by a networked act.  </p>

<p>This world deserves no confidence, <br />
And I'll give it no drooling trance. <br />
I pick and choose which worlds to love. <br />
I stare at her from far above. <br />
I have that power as of late, <br />
The crown is mine, the kingly state.  </p>
